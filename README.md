# CoastLineExplorer

Project for the course Advanced Robotics (320421) at Jacobs University Bremen.

The idea of this project is to implement a set of ROS nodes, which control the exploring behaviour of an underwater robot.
In our case the behaviour should be optimized towards exploring of coast lines with steep cliffs/reef structures.

Dependencies:
uwsim
ros

Build:
catkin_make

To be completed on another day.
